# Digit-Localization-and-Identification

Identifying few strokes on a piece of paper to be number may seem to be a piece of cake for us humans, thanks to millions of years of evolution and a highly evolved brain, but for a computer, this task can be really daunting.

In this project, I trained a convolutional neural network to identify digits. Then I took it a step further by writing another program which can locate digits in a picture and then identify that them.
